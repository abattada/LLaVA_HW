=====================
ELSA

Objects in the top corners: The top-left features a dark horse statue, and the top-right contains a metal helmet or piece of armor (possibly a suit of armor's headpiece).
---------------
Theme of the scene: This scene is themed around the Disney animated film Frozen, featuring the young sisters, Elsa and Anna, as statues.
=============================================
GATE

The photo was taken in the Arabian Coast area of Tokyo DisneySea in Japan.
------------------------------
The weather in the photo appears to be partly cloudy with sunlight breaking through, as indicated by the blue sky and white clouds, and the bright lighting on the buildings. A few people are holding umbrellas, suggesting a recent or impending light rain.
===================================================
TEMPLE

A large, tiered, stone temple or pyramid, resembling Mesoamerican architecture, surrounded by lush jungle foliage. In the foreground, there is a carved stone statue/totem and a lit torch on a pole.
----------------------
This is highly likely to be the "Temple of the Crystal Skull" attraction façade at Tokyo DisneySea in Japan, located in the Lost River Delta area. Alternatively, it could be a similar Mesoamerican-themed area in another theme park or a stylized photo of actual ancient ruins in Mexico (e.g., Mayan ruins like Chichen Itza, Palenque) or Guatemala (e.g., Tikal).
==================================
PLATES


The most important feature in this store is the display of colorful, hand-painted Turkish ceramic plates, bowls, and decorative tiles, reflecting the rich tradition of Iznik pottery.
---------------------
The tablewares on the shelf include plates, bowls (serving, soup, snack), tea sets, and coffee cups, often made of ceramic or porcelain.
============================
RAINBOW

Main Object: The most prominent feature visible in the sky is a rainbow.
----------------------
Besides the Main Object: In addition to the rainbow, I see various structures including a tall brick tower, a smokestack with vertical text, several low-roofed buildings, and the mast and upper structure of a large ship (possibly the S.S. Columbia mentioned on the sign). The sky is mostly overcast with heavy clouds.
